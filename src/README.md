# Sieve

This is an implementation of [The Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).
Its real purpose is to server as an example of packaging Nim code with Nix.

It's a bit of an exploration.
I'll update this readme if I become convinced that it's an exploration of a place worth going.
